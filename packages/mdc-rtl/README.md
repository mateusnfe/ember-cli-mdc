ember-cli-mdc-rtl
=======================

ember-cli addon for [`@material/rtl`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-rtl).

Pre-Octane Support
-------------------

Please see example code in `tests/dummy/app/templates` for examples of using rtl support
in your application pre-octane. 

If your application support Ember Octane, then this add-on
is primarily needed for dependency inclusions. We now set the `dir` attribute directly on
the corresponding element.
